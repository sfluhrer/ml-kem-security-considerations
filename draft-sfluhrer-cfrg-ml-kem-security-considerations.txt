1.  Introduction

   A large reliable quantum computer (often termed a Cryptographically
   Relevant Quantum Computer or CRQC) would be able to break protocols
   which rely on the traditional RSA, DH, or ECDH methods of securely
   exchanging keys.  Even though we do not believe, at the time of this
   writing, there exists a CRQC, there still remains the possibility
   that an adversary may record the protocol exchange, and then later
   (when they have access to a CRQC) go ahead and read the traffic.

   Because of this potential threat, NIST has standardized ML-KEM
   (Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism), which is
   standardized in FIPS 203 [FIPS203].  ML-KEM is used to generate a
   shared secret key between two parties.  One party (Alice) generates a
   public/private keypair, and sends the public key to the other party
   (Bob).  Bob uses the public key and some randomness to generate both
   the shared secret key and a ciphertext.  Bob then sends the
   ciphertext to Alice, who uses her private key to generate the same
   shared secret key.  NIST plans to standardize one or more code-based
   KEMs in the future.

   The fundamental security property is that someone listening to the
   exchanges (and thus obtains both the public key and the ciphertext)
   cannot reconstruct the shared secret key and this is true even if the
   adversary has access to a CRQC.  ML-KEM is IND-CCA2 secure, that is,
   it remains secure even if an adversary is able to submit arbitrary
   ciphertexts and observe the resulting shared key.  Submitting invalid
   ciphertexts to a ML-KEM.Decaps does not help the attacker obtain
   information about the decryption key of the PKE-Decrypt function
   inside the ML-KEM.Decaps.  Substituting the public key Alice sends
   Bob by another public key chosen by the attacker will not help the
   attacker get any information about Alice's private key, it would just
   make Alice and Bob not have a same shared secret key.  For practical
   purposes, IND-CCA2 means that ML-KEM is secure to use with static
   public keys.

   ML-KEM is what is termed a Key Encapsulation Mechanism.  One common
   misunderstanding of that term is the expectation that Bob freely
   chooses the shared secret, and encrypts that when sending to Alice.
   What happens in ML-KEM is that randomness from both sides are used to
   contribute to the shared secret.  That is, ML-KEM internally
   generates the shared secret in a way that Bob cannot select the
   value.  Now, Bob can generate a number of ciphertext/shared secret
   pairs, and select the shared secret that he prefers, but he cannot
   freely choose it or make secrets shared with two parties be equal.
   This is different from RSA-KEM [RFC5990], where Bob cannot select the
   value, but can encapsulate the same shared secret to many recipients.

   A KEM (such as ML-KEM) sounds like it may be a drop-in replacement
   for Diffie-Hellman, however this is not the case as in Diffie-
   Hellman, the parties exchange two public keys, whereas in a KEM, the
   ciphertext is necessarily a function of Alice's public key, and thus
   can only be useful only with that specific public key.  As long a the
   application can handle larger public keys and ciphertexts, a KEM is a
   drop-in replacement for 'ephemeral-ephemeral' key exchange in
   protocols like TLS [RFC8446] and SSH [RFC4253] as well as 'static-
   ephemeral' key exchange in protocols like ECIES/HPKE [RFC9180].  A
   KEM is not a drop-in replacement in applications such as the Diffie-
   Hellman ratchet in Signal [SIGNAL], implicit 'ephemeral-static' DH
   authentication in Noise [NOISE], Wireguard [WIRE], and EDHOC
   [RFC9528], and 'static-static' configurations in CMS [RFC6278] and
   Group OSCORE [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm], where both sides have
   long-term public keys.  Furthermore ML-KEM is not a drop-in
   replacement for RSA-KEM as RSA-KEM can encapsulate the same shared
   secret to many recipients whereas ML-KEM cannot.

2.  Using ML-KEM

   To use ML-KEM, there are three steps involved

2.1.  ML-KEM Key Generation

   The first step for Alice is to generate a public and private keypair.

   In FIPS 203, this function is termed ML-KEM.KeyGen() (see section 7.1
   of [FIPS203]).  It internally calls the random number generator for a
   seed and produces both a public key (termed an encapsulation key in
   FIPS 203) and a private key (termed a decapsulation key).

   The public key can be freely published (and Bob will need it for his
   part of the process); this step may be performed simply by
   transmitting the key to Bob.  However, the private key must be kept
   secret.

2.2.  ML-KEM Encapsulation

   The second step is for Bob to generate a ciphertext and a shared
   secret key.

   To perform this step, Bob would first run the Encapsulation Key Check
   on Alice's public key as outlined at the beginning of section 7.2 of
   [FIPS203].  If that test passes, then Bob would perform the what FIPS
   203 terms as ML-KEM.Encaps() (see section 7.2 of [FIPS203]).  This
   step takes the validated public key, internally calls the random
   number generator for a seed, and produces both a ciphertext and a
   32-byte shared secret key.

   The ciphertext can be transmitted back to Alice; if the exchange is
   successful, the 32-byte shared secret key will be the key shared with
   Alice.

   It may be that some libraries combine the validation and the
   encapsulation step; you should check whether the library you are
   using does.  For static public keys, the Encapsulation Key Check only
   needs to be performed once.

2.3.  ML-KEM Decapsulation

   The third and final step is for Alice to take the ciphertext and
   generate the shared secret key.

   To perform this step, Alice would first run the Decapsulation Key
   Check on Bob's ciphertext as outlined at the beginning of section 7.3
   of [FIPS203].  If that test passes, then Bob would perform the what
   FIPS 203 terms as ML-KEM.Decaps() (see section 7.3 of [FIPS203]).
   This step takes the ciphertext from Bob and the private key that was
   previously generated by Alice, and produces a 32-byte shared secret
   key.

   If the exchange is successful, the 32-byte key generated on both
   sides will be the same.

   It may be that some libraries combine the validation and the
   decapsulation step; you should check whether the library you are
   using does.

2.4.  ML-KEM Parameter Sets

   ML-KEM comes with three parameter sets; ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768 and
   ML-KEM-1024.  It is assumed that Alice and Bob both know which
   parameter sets they use (either by negotiation or by having one
   selection fixed in the protocol).

   Table 1 shows a summary of how those parameter sets differ:

    +=============+=========+=========+=========+=========+===========+
    |             | pk size | sk size | ct size | ss size | as strong |
    |             |         |         |         |         |     as    |
    +=============+=========+=========+=========+=========+===========+
    | ML-KEM-512  |     800 |    1632 |     768 |    32   |  AES-128  |
    +-------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+-----------+
    | ML-KEM-768  |    1184 |    2400 |    1088 |    32   |  AES-192  |
    +-------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+-----------+
    | ML-KEM-1024 |    1568 |    3168 |    1568 |    32   |  AES-256  |
    +-------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+-----------+

        Table 1: pk = public key, sk = private key, ct = ciphertext,
                   ss = shared key, all lengths in bytes

   Table 2 shows an example of ML-KEM performance [EBACS]:

     +=============+================+===============+===============+
     |             | key generation | encapsulation | decapsulation |
     +=============+================+===============+===============+
     | ML-KEM-512  |         244000 |        153000 |        202000 |
     +-------------+----------------+---------------+---------------+
     | ML-KEM-768  |         142000 |        103000 |        134000 |
     +-------------+----------------+---------------+---------------+
     | ML-KEM-1024 |         109000 |         77000 |         99000 |
     +-------------+----------------+---------------+---------------+

       Table 2: Single-core performance in operation per second on
                             AMD Ryzen 7 7700

   As can be seen from Table 1 and Table 1, ML-KEM has significantly
   larger public keys and ciphertexts than ECDH but very good
   performance.

3.  KEM Security Considerations

   This section pertains to KEM (Key Encapsulation Mechanisms) in
   general, including ML-KEM

   To use a KEM, you need to use a high-quality source of entropy during
   both the key-pair generation and ciphertext generation steps.  If an
   adversary can recover the random bits used in either of these
   processes, they can recover the shared secret.  If an adversary can
   recover the random bits used during key generation, they can recover
   the secret key.

   Alice needs to keep her private key secret.  It is recommended that
   she zeroize her private key when she will have no further need of it.

   A KEM (including ML-KEM) provides no authentication of either
   communicating party.  If an adversary could replace either the public
   key or the ciphertext with its own, it would generate a shared key
   with Alice or Bob.  Hence, it is important that the protocol that
   uses a KEM lets Bob be able to verify that the public key he obtains
   came from Alice and that the ciphertext that Alice receives came from
   Bob (that is, an entity that Alice is willing to communicate with).
   Such verification can be performed by cryptographic methods such as
   digital signatures or a MAC to verify integrity of the protocol
   exchange transcript.

4.  ML-KEM Security Considerations

   This section pertains specifically to ML-KEM, and may not be true of
   KEMs in general.

   To use ML-KEM, you need a source of random bits with security
   strength equal to greater than the security strength of the KEM
   during both key generation and encapsulation steps.  The
   cryptographic library that implements ML-KEM may access this source
   of randomness internally.

   Alice must keep her private key secret (both private and secure from
   modification).  It is recommended that she zeroizes her private key
   when she will have no further need of it.

   If the ciphertext that Alice receives from Bob is tampered with
   (either by small modification or by replacing it with an entirely
   different ciphertext), the shared secret key that Alice derives will
   be uncorrelated with the shared secret key that Bob obtains.  An
   attacker will not be able to determine any information about the
   correct shared secret key or Alice's private key, even if the
   attacker obtains Alice's modified shared secret key which is the
   output of the ML-KEM.Decaps function taking the modified ciphertext
   as input.

   It is secure to reuse a public key multiple times.  That is, instead
   of Alice generating a fresh public and private keypair for each
   exchange, Alice may generate a public key once, and then publish that
   public key, and use it for multiple incoming ciphertexts, generating
   multiple shared secret keys.  While this is safe, it is recommended
   that if the protocol allows it (if Alice and Bob exchange messages
   anyways) that Alice generates a fresh keypair each time (and zeroize
   the private key immediately after) to obtain Perfect Forward Secrecy.
   Be noted that generally key generation of ML-KEM is very fast, see
   Table 2.  That is, if Alice's system is subverted (either by a hacker
   or a legal warrant), the previous communications remain secure
   (because Alice no longer has the information needed to recover the
   shared secret keys).

   Alice and Bob must perform the Key Check steps (the Encapsulation Key
   Check on the public key for Bob, the Decapsulation Key Check on the
   ciphertext for Alice).  The cryptographical libraries that Alice and
   Bob use may automatically perform such checks; if so, that should be
   verified.

   The shared secret key for all three parameter sets, ML-KEM-512, ML-
   KEM-768 and ML-KEM-1024 are 32 bytes which are indistinguishable from
   32-byte pseudorandom byte-strings of 128, 192 and 256 bits of
   strengths respectively.  As such, it is suitable both to use directly
   as a symmetric key (for use by a symmetric cipher such as AES or a
   MAC), and for inserting into a Key Derivation Function.  This is in
   contrast to a Diffie-Hellman (or ECDH) operation, where the output is
   distinguishable from random.
